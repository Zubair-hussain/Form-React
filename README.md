# React Form Project

This is a React project that demonstrates a simple form with input validation, usage of local storage, and customization to prevent the browser's default form action on submit. The form includes fields for the user's name, parent information, class, and subject. If the form is submitted without completing all fields, an error message is displayed.

## Features

- **Local Storage:** Stores form data to retain information between page refreshes.
- **Prevent Default Action:** Prevents the browser from reloading on form submission by using `e.preventDefault()`.
- **Validation:** Simple validation to ensure all fields are filled in before allowing submission.
